<P>A series of recorded excerpts of repeated movements and gestures associated with Underperformances.
Underperformances is an ongoing exploration of architectural acoustics
that is driven by the interaction of a microphone, mixer,
loudspeakers, and my body with select rooms and other resonant
environments. Instead of serving as documentation of past
performances, the sounds included here have been recorded with minimal
resonant properties and function as a surplus or residue to actual
performances. They focus on the textures of my skin, and fabrics and
materials (including pants, shirts, socks, shoes, and gloves).
Realizations of Underperformances feature the spatial manipulation of
a wide variety of sounds projected at the threshold of acoustic
feedback as they move between air and solid materials. Some of the
recordings were made for a sound installation included in the group
exhibition "Threshing Floors" (Cuchifritos Gallery + Project Space,
2015) and others have been made for Bureau Audio. More information can be found <a href="http://earwaveevent.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Carter.pdf" target="_blank"><u>here.</u></a>
