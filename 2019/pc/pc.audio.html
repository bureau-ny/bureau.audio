Plaster Cramp* is an ongoing experimental archive of readings, descriptions, sounds, & other aural ephemera for the vision and reading impaired, created by Maliea Croy. Born partially deaf, Croy started to go progressively blind in her 20s and now seeks to transmute an ever-changing visual world through collected sounds. Maliea Croy is a therapist/artist living & working in the Bay Area.<BR /><BR />

* Plaster Cramp is named after Jorge Luis Borges' short story "The Library of Babel" in which he imagines a library that encompasses all possible information in the universe in every combination. <em>The Plaster Cramp</em> is the name of one of the few books the protagonist finds that is semi-legible, though completely nonsensical. Borges went blind shortly after being appointed Director of the National Library in Argentina. He talked about being given access to all the books he could imagine, but without being able to read them himself. He often wrote about "irreality," libraries, labyrinths, gardens, smells, nighttime, and cats.
